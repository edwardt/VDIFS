VDIFS

This is a filesystem module for serving raw-image versions of VirtualBox drive
files suitable for mounting and manipulating with tools like fdisk and losetup.

Building
--------
Edit the Makefile so that the KERNELDIR and ARCH variables are set correctly.
KERNELDIR should point to the location of the kernel this module is being built
for, and ARCH should be match the architecture the kernel was built for (for
example, this would be set to "um" when being built against a User Mode Linux
kernel). This will produce a file named "vdifs.ko", which can be inserted into
the kernel it was built against.

Usage
-----
Once inserted, this module provides a filesystem called "vdifs". To mount a VDI
file, the usual mount command should work: "mount -o loop -t vdifs foo.vdi dir/"
will mount the VDI file foo.vdi on the directory dir/. When the file has been
mounted, there will be a single file in the mount directory called "image"; this
is the raw-image version of the VDI disk. It can be manipulated like any other
drive image.

Caveats
-------
At present, only the 1.2 version of the VDI format is supported. Reads and
writes on dynamic VDI files will also fail due to a limitation of the loopback
system (this should change soon).

New Versions
------------
Newer versions of this module may be available via git at
